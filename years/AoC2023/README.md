## Tasks
A list of the tasks of this year with explanations, difficulty judgements,
 thoughts and a quick overview of my solutions.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff9900/000000?text=+) Day 1: Trebuchet?! 
* **Question:** From of list of strings, find the first and last digit (both numbers and written out).
* **Solution:** Breaking the string into blocks of digits and letters (using regex) and matching written words within the blocks.
* **Difficulty:** `str.find()` and `str.index()` return the first index with match, which can cause some numbers to be missed. Example, if a final block contained `'ninetwonine'`, the last number found would be 2 instead of 9.
* **Thoughts:** Way to difficult of a first day, but afterwards a good challenge.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 2: Cube Conundrum
* **Question:** Find maximum numbers within a string correlated on the word (color) that comes after.
* **Solution:** Splitting the string to get pairs of numbers and colors and a dictionary to keep track of the maximums. 
* **Thoughts:** Not very difficult; The game is interesting, and it would be fun to see it coming back more difficult.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 3: Gear Ratios 
* **Question:** In a grid of characters; Find number that are next to `*`, and maintain which numbers are next to those stars.
* **Solution:** Create position grid with only numbers and symbols; Merge the digits of numbers so their value and positions are maintained; Using the grid, determine if those positions have non-numeric neighbors / `*`.
* **Thoughts:** The hardest part was to parse the data correctly into the grid system so numbers and their positions were maintained; After that the trickiest thing to avoid was to not make incorrect assumptions such as: "Each number only appears once on each line", "Each number can only be adjacent to one gears" and "Each gear has always to adjacent numbers"; I only made a mistake with the first assumption, the other were easy to anticipate.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 4: Scratchcards 
* **Question:** Determine how many scratchcards are in a pile. Each winning scratchcard creates a copy of the next 'X' scratchcards where 'X' is the number of winning numbers a card has.
* **Solution:** Create a dictionary containing all cards once. If card 'Y' wins 'X' times, add 'Y' copies to the next 'X' dict entries (Can also be done with a list).
* **Thoughts:** I made no mistakes on this question and the code looks quite minimal and readable. Nice little challenge.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ccff00/000000?text=+) Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer 
* **Question:** Given a series of mappings and initial ranges, after sequentially mapping the ranges through the series, what is the lowest resulting value?
* **Solution:** Go backwards through the mappings with the lowest possible final values one at a time and check if the final number in within the initial range.
* **Thoughts:** I think we are out of the very easy questions. This was the first question where na√Øve algorithms could not work due to runtime issues. Fortunately, the second-slowest option was still reasonable to implement and had a runtime around 4 minutes.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 6: Wait For It 
* **Question:** Calculate how many options there are to hold a button to win a race.
* **Solution:** Loop until you find the first race winning value; Then loop for the back until you find the last race winning value; Calculate the difference, which will be the amount of winning options. 
* **Thoughts:** Surprisingly easy, the wording alluded to it being more difficult.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ccff00/000000?text=+) Day 7: Camel Cards 
* **Question:** Sort poker hands with jokers!
* **Solution:** Using insertion sort, compare hands until the to-be-inserted hand is the weakest in the comparison and insert fittingly. Use count and some logic to determine the strength of a hand.
* **Thoughts:** The tricky part was to determine the strength of a hand. It was a nice logic puzzle involving jokers and I missed a case in my code where 4 jokers (and an additional card) would often classify as a four of a kind instead of a five of a kind. Once this missed case was detected it was easy to add an explicit case for it.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff9900/000000?text=+) Day 8: Haunted Wasteland 
* **Question:** Follow instructions to leave a maze multiple times simultaneously. Find at which point in time all simultaneous paths are on an exit node.
* **Solution:** Compute for all paths the distance time it takes to find an exit node, use the lcm to calculate a point where they all overlap.
* **Thoughts:** It took me a while to figure out how to find the cycles in the paths to calculate the lcm. Fortunately, the puzzle input was nice so after a bit of checking the first time a node finds the exit it will repeat in that order.

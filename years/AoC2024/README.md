### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 1: Historian Hysteria
* **Question:** Use one list to search for counts of numbers in another list
* **Solution:** Loop over list 1, count occurrences in list 2; na√Øve method
* **Thoughts:** Okay start, not too difficult, not too too easy. Theming seems lower this year, will see in the coming weeks

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
* **Question:** Check if a report is safe, ignoring one bad number in the sequence
* **Solution:** Loop over the numbers until a bad level is encountered. Remove either the left or right level (one of which is bad) and check again if the report is safe (without removing any more levels).
* **Thoughts:** More difficult than I expected at day 2 early in the morning, got stuck a little on trying to ignore numbers instead of removing and checking again.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 3: Mull It Over 
* **Question:** Find multiplication statements in a random string of characters.
* **Solution:** Use regex!
* **Thoughts:** Always fun to use regex :D

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 4: Ceres Search 
* **Question:** Find the word XMAS and X's of the word MAS in a wordseeker
* **Solution:** Check every location of the wordseeker if it has an A (or X in part 1). Then try to map all possible associated patterns (XMAS or MAS - MAS) on that location.
* **Thoughts:** It was kind a brute-forcy but a neat challenge.

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 5: Print Queue 
* **Question:** Fix the order of given lists of numbers according to given order rulesets
* **Solution:** Keep a dict with all numbers that must be in-front or behind a number to easily check if a number is in order. Then iteratively add numbers to the front of the list if they are allowed in order.
* **Thoughts:** Not having any big edge-cases is nice and ensures a non-frustrating solve

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ccff00/000000?text=+) Day 6: Guard Gallivant 
* **Question:** Figure out where to place an obstruction to make the guard walk in loops
* **Solution:** Place an obstruction at every point in the path and check if it creates a loop
* **Thoughts:** I have a very slow solution, but the question was great

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Day 7: Bridge Repair 
* **Question:** Figure out if a total can be made using given values and some operators
* **Solution:** Recursively compute the total of the values with different operators until the total is found or all options have been checked
* **Thoughts:** It seemed way more complex that it was, since a recursive brute-force method worked splendidly

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ccff00/000000?text=+) Day 8: Resonant Collinearity 
* **Question:** Find all grid positions that are in line with a set of given beacons
* **Solution:** Calculate all the antinode positions inside the frame based on the numeric location of the antennas pairs
* **Thoughts:** This seemed a lot like the code I wrote for work

### ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff9900/000000?text=+) Day 9: Disk Fragmenter 
* **Question:** Defragment a file system given a disk map that describes the file system
* **Solution:** Keep an ordered list with the id, size and gap behind the file. Go from the files in the back to the front while checking the gaps from front to back to check if there is space for the file to move. If a space is found, move the file in the ordered list and adjust the gaps of the file, the previous file in front and the new file in front, to maintain the correct gaps.
* **Thoughts:** I forgot to do this day and wanted an easy one before bed... it wasn't that easy and took quite some time
